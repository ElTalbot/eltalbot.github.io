            <p class="paboutpage">Why an interest in technology?</p>
            <p class="aboutanswer">
              I was looking for a way to channel my passion for
              <span class="highlight"
                >building, creativity, helping people</span
              >
              and fell into the world of tech. <br /><br />The founding of my
              business along with my experience in the dynamic world of a
              <span class="highlight">software company startup</span>
              highlighted the power of tech and its potential to drive my
              business further. <br /><br />Working in the world of technology
              was something that never seemed possible for me. Being given the
              opportunity to foster this newfound interest and be able to use it
              for good is something I want to nurture.

              What excites me the most about working in the tech industry?
            </p>
            <p class="aboutanswer">
              Having the opportunity to
              <span class="highlight">collaborate</span> with other like-minded
              people to build, create and develop in a way that has a positive
              impact in society. <br /><br />The ongoing changes and
              advancements in the world of software brings with it new
              possibilities, keeping
              <span class="highlight">everyday exciting and different.</span>
              <br /><br />
              The brevity of <span class="highlight">scope</span> the tech
              industry has, the collaboration and possibilities right round the
              corner that offer the potential to influence the future of
              technology are things that really excite me. <br /><br />
              The <span class="highlight">reach of tech</span> - being apart of
              an industry that has a positive impact in a quiet low key way, be
              it for your local neighbour or for a community on the other side
              of the world is something I strive to be apart of.

              Two things. <br /><br />1. To bring what I have learnt and
              <span class="highlight">make a difference</span> professionally -
              to work alongside others to build and code with passion, integrity
              and respect whilst not forgetting to have fun <br /><br />2. The
              opportunity to
              <span class="highlight"
                >collaborate with other passionate people</span
              >
              on a more personal level and see the evolution of an idea right
              from conception all the way to deployment.
